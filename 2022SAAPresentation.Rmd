- Projectile points are an under-studied aspect of material culture in the Hohokam Classic period
- This study uses geometric morphometrics, clustering, and network methods to study patterns of projectile point outline similarity among Tonto Basin sites
- Projectile points are also compared to ceramics,  site type (architectural or other feature defining the site), and spatial distance

## Tonto Basin and the Roosevelt Platform Mound Study

```{r fig.cap="The Roosevelt Platform Mound Study (RPMS) was one of several CRM projects conducted during the 1990s around the Roosevelt Reservoir [@Rice1998-ku]"}

```{r fig.cap="The sites are divided into five clusters, and the heaviest occupation occurred during the Roosevelt phase (AD 1275-1325)"}

## Dataset

```{r}

knitr::kable(sites %>% select(name = ArchaMapName,area = Area, phase = Phase, ceramics = Ceramics, points = Points, architecture) %>% arrange(area,name,phase))

## Projectile point typologies

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('TontoBasinProjBoundaries.png')
```


:::

::: {.column}
- One of the reasons regional projectile point studies are challenging is the difficulty harmonizing typologies
- The RPMS project decided to create two idiosyncratic typologies for their report [@Rice1994-rk]
- Justice [-@Justice2002-cf] has numerous overlapping types as shown in this figure
- Sliva [-@Sliva2006-nq] also describes a number of point types that would fit the points in this study

## Tonto points

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('PointsClustersTontoSub.png')
```


:::

::: {.column}
- Each projectile point was scanned with a flatbed scanner and the outline was extracted and imported into R [@R_Core_Team2022-wb] using the Momocs package [@Bonhomme2014-gt], which was also used for all geometric morphometric (GM) analysis
- Points were flipped horizontally so the greatest area was on the right side to reduce orientation bias
- 12 harmonics were used and 8 principal components (95% of variation) were kept

## Conclusion

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Some architectural correlation
- Less spatial correlation
- Points
    - Dense network [see @Buchanan2019-vn]
    - Rock Island was highly central
    - Roomblocks were peripheral
- Ceramics 
    - Roomblocks were central
- Compounds tended to cluster together
- Platform mounds were usually central
